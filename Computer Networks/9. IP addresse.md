# 🌍 Lecture 9: Basics of IP Addressing – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand IP addressing basics
* View IP address on real devices
* Identify valid and invalid IPv4 addresses

---

## 🧾 What is an IP Address?

* **IP** = Internet Protocol
* Used to **identify every node** in a computer network
* Two types: **IPv4** (focus here) and **IPv6**
* IP addresses are **logical** (can be changed by location)

---

## 🔢 IPv4 Address Format

* Written as: `x.x.x.x` where `x ∈ [0, 255]`
* Total: 4 octets = **32 bits**
* Example: `192.168.150.2`

---

## ⚙️ Assigning IP Addresses

* Can be **manual** or **dynamic** (via DHCP)
* Logical: Can reassign based on network location

---

## 🖥️ How to View IP Address on Windows

1. Open **Command Prompt** (`cmd`)
2. Run `ipconfig`
3. Find IP under **IPv4 Address** in Wi-Fi or Ethernet section

---

## ✔️ Valid vs ❌ Invalid IP Addresses

* ✅ **Valid**: Four octets, each 0–255, decimal only
* ❌ **Invalid**: Any octet >255, wrong format, or non-decimal characters

### 🧪 Examples:

* `192.168.1.1` → ✅ Valid
* `10.0.0.256` → ❌ Invalid (256 > 255)
* `255.255.255.255` → ✅ Valid (last possible IPv4)
* `192.168.1.2e` → ❌ Invalid (contains letter)
* `123.456.789.0` → ❌ Invalid (octets > 255)
* `10.1.1.1.1` → ❌ Invalid (too many octets)
