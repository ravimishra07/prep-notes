# 🔢 Lecture 11: Basics of Port Addressing – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand what a **port number** is
* Learn the role of port numbers in delivering data to the correct process
* Know how to view port numbers on real devices

---

## 🧭 Analogy for Understanding

* **IP Address** = City (locates the network)
* **MAC Address** = Apartment (locates the device)
* **Port Number** = Room Number (locates the process within the device)

---

## 📌 What is a Port Number?

* Identifies the **process** on a device (like a browser, app, etc.)
* Needed because many processes can run on the same device
* A port number is a **communication endpoint**

### Port Number Range

* **0 to 65535**
* Split into:

  * **Well-known ports** (0–1023): e.g., 80 (HTTP), 25 (SMTP)
  * **Dynamic/Ephemeral ports** (49152–65535): assigned temporarily by OS

---

## 🧠 Example:

* YouTube video request via Google Chrome gets assigned source port `64323`
* Destination server (YouTube) replies to that exact port to deliver video

---

## 🖥️ How to View Port Numbers (Windows)

1. Open **Start Menu**
2. Type `resmon` → Open **Resource Monitor**
3. Go to **Network tab** → View active **port numbers** per app/process

## ⚠️ 3 Key Points to Ponder

| Layer           | Address Used                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Network Layer   | Source & Destination **IP**   |
| Data Link Layer | Source & Destination **MAC**  |
| Transport Layer | Source & Destination **Port** |

Each is essential to ensure the data reaches the **right process on the right device within the right network**.
