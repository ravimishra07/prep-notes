## 🔢 Cable & Port Formulas

### 🔸 Ring Topology

* **Cables**: `n`
* **Ports per device**: 2
* **Total Ports**: `2 × n`

### 🔸 Star Topology

* **Cables**: `n`
* **Ports per device**: 1 + central device with `n` ports
* **Total Ports**: `2 × n`

### 🔸 Mesh Topology (Full)

* **Cables**: `n × (n - 1) / 2`
* **Ports per device**: `n - 1`
* **Total Ports**: `n × (n - 1)`

## 🧠 Example Problem 1 – Ring Topology

**Given**: 6 nodes
**Find**:

* Cables = 6
* Ports per device = 2
* Total Ports = `6 × 2 = 12`

---

## 🧠 Example Problem 2 – Traffic Efficiency

**Q**: In which topology is traffic congestion minimal?
**Ans**: **Mesh Topology** (dedicated lines, no shared traffic)

---

## 🧠 Example Problem 3 – Star Topology

**Given**: 5 nodes

* **Cables** = 5
* **Ports per device** = 1
* **Central hub/switch** = 5 ports
* **Total Ports** = `2 × 5 = 10`

## 🏠 Homework Problem – Mesh Topology

**Given**: 6 nodes in mesh topology
**Find**:

* Cables = `6 × (6 - 1) / 2 = 15`
* Ports per device = `6 - 1 = 5`
* Total Ports = `6 × 5 = 30`

---

## 🔁 Summary

* Use formulas to scale quickly for large networks
* Mesh = Best for performance, worst for cost
* Star = Easy to implement, centralized risk
* Ring = Balanced but unidirectional and fragile

Let’s break it down clearly. You have 6 nodes in a full mesh topology. Here’s how we calculate:

⸻

🔧 1. Number of Cables

✅ Formula:

\text{Number of Cables} = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}

✅ Why this works:

In a full mesh, each node connects directly to every other node.
So for n nodes, you are selecting pairs of nodes (like a handshake), and there are n choose 2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} such unique pairs.

🔢 Example (n = 6):

\frac{6(6 - 1)}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15 \text{ cables}

⸻

🔌 2. Number of Ports per Device

✅ Formula:

\text{Ports per Device} = n - 1

✅ Why this works:

Each node connects to every other node — so it needs n - 1 ports (one for each connection).

🔢 Example (n = 6):

6 - 1 = 5 \text{ ports per node}

⸻

🧮 3. Total Ports in the Network

✅ Formula:

\text{Total Ports} = n \times (n - 1)

✅ Why this works:

You calculated n - 1 ports per device, and there are n devices. So total = all devices × their ports.

Also: Since every cable connects two ports, and we have 15 cables, the total ports = 15 × 2 = 30 — matches the above.

🔢 Example (n = 6):

6 \times (6 - 1) = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ total ports}

⸻

✅ Final Answer:
	•	Cables: 15
	•	Ports per device: 5
	•	Total ports in the network: 30

Let me know if you want visual diagrams or want to test with a different value of n.
