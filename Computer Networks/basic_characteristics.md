# ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Characteristics of Computer Networks (Lecture 2)

## ‚úÖ Outcomes

* Understand the importance of:

  * Fault Tolerance
  * Scalability
  * Quality of Service (QoS)
  * Security

---

## üß© Four Key Characteristics

1. **Fault Tolerance**
2. **Scalability**
3. **Quality of Service (QoS)**
4. **Security**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fault Tolerance

* Network continues to function even after **failures**
* Ensures **no loss of service**
* Example: If one router/link fails, data is rerouted via alternate paths

### Analogy:

> If your usual route home is blocked, you take another ‚Äî that‚Äôs fault tolerance.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability

* Network can **grow** without compromising **performance**
* Example: Internet adds thousands of devices every second but still runs smoothly

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Quality of Service (QoS)

* Network sets **priorities** and manages **traffic flow**
* Reduces **delay** and **packet loss**

### Example:

> Voice calls are prioritized over emails because delay in real-time voice hurts more than email delay.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Security

* Prevents **unauthorized access**, **data theft**, **modification**, or **forgery**
* Provides:

  * **Confidentiality**: Data is encrypted, readable only by sender/receiver
  * **Integrity**: Data is not altered during transmission
  * **Availability**: System/resources remain accessible despite attacks

## üß† Quick Recap Table

| Characteristic  | Purpose                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Fault Tolerance | Avoid service disruption after failure       |
| Scalability     | Handle growth without slowdowns              |
| QoS             | Prioritize critical traffic, reduce lag/loss |
| Security        | Safeguard data and ensure trust              |
