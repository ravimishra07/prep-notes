# 🧾 Lecture 10: Basics of MAC Addressing – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand MAC address basics
* Know the difference between IP and MAC address
* Learn how to view MAC address in real devices

---

## 📡 What is a MAC Address?

* **MAC** = Media Access Control
* Unique **hardware address** assigned to every network device
* Used for **local** identification in a LAN
* Cannot be changed (burned into the NIC by manufacturer)
* **48 bits**, written in **hexadecimal**
* Example: `70-20-84-00-ED-FC`

## 🆚 IP vs MAC Address

| Feature  | IP Address                 | MAC Address                     |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Type     | Logical (can change)       | Physical (fixed)                |
| Format   | Decimal (e.g. 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal (e.g. 94-39-E5-...) |
| Bits     | 32 bits (IPv4)             | 48 bits                         |
| Use Case | Router-based forwarding    | Switch-based forwarding         |

* **Router → IP** based decisions
* **Switch → MAC** based forwarding

## 🖥️ How to View MAC Address on Windows

1. Open Command Prompt (`cmd`)
2. Run: `ipconfig /all`
3. Find under: **Physical Address** (for Ethernet or Wi-Fi)

---

## 🧠 Analogy

* **IP Address** = Person's location (can change)
* **MAC Address** = Person's name (permanent)
