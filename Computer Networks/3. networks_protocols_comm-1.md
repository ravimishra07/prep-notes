# 🔗 Lecture 3: Network Protocols & Communication – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand data communication and flow
* Learn about simplex, half duplex, and full duplex
* Importance and role of protocols
* Elements of a protocol

---

## 📡 Data Communication

* **Data Communication** = Exchange of data between two nodes via a medium (e.g., cable)

## 🔄 Data Flow Types

| Type        | Description                          | Example        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Simplex     | One-way communication                | Keyboard → CPU |
| Half Duplex | Two-way, but one direction at a time | Walkie-talkie  |
| Full Duplex | Two-way simultaneously               | Telephone call |

## 📜 What is a Protocol?

* **Protocol** = Set of **rules** that govern data communication
* Ensures: What, How, and When communication happens

### 🔑 Basic Components of Any Communication:

* **Source** (Sender)
* **Destination** (Receiver)
* **Medium** (Channel)
* **Protocol** (Rules)

---

## 📋 Why Protocols Are Needed

* Ensure mutual understanding between sender and receiver
* Prevent chaos (e.g., language mismatch, speed mismatch)

---

## 🧱 Elements of a Protocol

### 1️⃣ Message Encoding

* Data is converted to **signals** (wired) or **waves** (wireless) for transmission
* Receiver **decodes** the signals into understandable data

### 2️⃣ Message Formatting & Encapsulation

* Agreed **structure** for data
* Add **source and destination info** to the message for correct delivery

### 3️⃣ Message Size

* Large data is **broken into smaller chunks** to match link capacity

### 4️⃣ Message Timing

* **Flow control**: Prevent sender from overwhelming receiver
* **Timeouts & Acknowledgements**: Ensure delivery confirmation

### 5️⃣ Message Delivery Options

* **Unicast**: One sender → One receiver
* **Multicast**: One sender → Some receivers
* **Broadcast**: One sender → All receivers

## 🧠 Quick Recap

* Data Communication = Exchange between nodes
* Flow Types = Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex
* Protocols = Set of communication rules
* Elements = Encoding, Formatting, Size, Timing, Delivery
