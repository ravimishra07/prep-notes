# 📡 Computer Networks – Flash Notes (Lecture 1)

## 🔰 Introduction

* **Computer Network** = Set of *nodes* connected via *communication links*
* Used for **resource sharing**, **communication**, and **remote access**


## 🌐 Scope of Networking

* Supports **learning**, **communication**, **work**, and **play**
* Enables real-time communication (e.g., WhatsApp)
* Facilitates remote work and entertainment

## 🧱 Course Structure
* Based on **layered architecture**
* Each layer is a separate chapter
* Ends with **network security** module

## ✅ Outcomes of Lecture 1

* Understand: What is a computer network?
* Identify: End devices vs Intermediary devices

## 🧾 Definition

**Computer Network** = Set of **nodes** connected by **communication links**

### 🔹 Nodes

Devices that can **send**, **receive**, or **both**:

* Computers
* Printers
* Servers
* Routers, Switches, Bridges

### 🔹 Communication Links

* **Wired**: Physical cables (e.g., Ethernet)
* **Wireless**: Medium like air (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
* Role: Carry data between nodes

---

## 🖧 Real-world Example

**Mixed Network:**

* Wired links: PC to Switch to Router
* Wireless links: Smartphones to Wi-Fi router

### 🧩 Devices in a Sample Network:

#### End Devices:

* Computers, Smartphones, Tablets, Printers

#### Intermediary Devices:

* Switches, Routers, Cell towers, Internet backbone nodes

---

## 💡 Key Insight

* Networks enable **resource sharing** (e.g., one printer used by many computers)
* Saves **infrastructure cost**

---

## 🧪 Scenario Task (Recap Exercise)

> Identify end and intermediary devices from a sample diagram.
> Classify clearly in two lists.

---

## 📌 Final Definitions Recap

* **Computer Network**: Nodes + Communication links
* **End Devices**: Source/destination of data (e.g., PC, printer)
* **Intermediary Devices**: Forward data (e.g., router, switch)
