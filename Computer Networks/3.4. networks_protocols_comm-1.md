# 🔗 Lecture 3: Network Protocols & Communication – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand data communication and flow
* Learn about simplex, half duplex, and full duplex
* Importance and role of protocols
* Elements of a protocol

---

## 📡 Data Communication

* **Data Communication** = Exchange of data between two nodes via a medium (e.g., cable)

## 🔄 Data Flow Types

| Type        | Description                          | Example        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Simplex     | One-way communication                | Keyboard → CPU |
| Half Duplex | Two-way, but one direction at a time | Walkie-talkie  |
| Full Duplex | Two-way simultaneously               | Telephone call |

## 📜 What is a Protocol?

* **Protocol** = Set of **rules** that govern data communication
* Ensures: What, How, and When communication happens

### 🔑 Basic Components of Any Communication:

* **Source** (Sender)
* **Destination** (Receiver)
* **Medium** (Channel)
* **Protocol** (Rules)

---

## 📋 Why Protocols Are Needed

* Ensure mutual understanding between sender and receiver
* Prevent chaos (e.g., language mismatch, speed mismatch)

---

## 🧱 Elements of a Protocol

### 1️⃣ Message Encoding

* Data is converted to **signals** (wired) or **waves** (wireless) for transmission
* Receiver **decodes** the signals into understandable data

### 2️⃣ Message Formatting & Encapsulation

* Agreed **structure** for data
* Add **source and destination info** to the message for correct delivery

### 3️⃣ Message Size

* Large data is **broken into smaller chunks** to match link capacity

### 4️⃣ Message Timing

* **Flow control**: Prevent sender from overwhelming receiver
* **Timeouts & Acknowledgements**: Ensure delivery confirmation

### 5️⃣ Message Delivery Options

* **Unicast**: One sender → One receiver
* **Multicast**: One sender → Some receivers
* **Broadcast**: One sender → All receivers

---

## 🧠 Quick Recap

* Data Communication = Exchange between nodes
* Flow Types = Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex
* Protocols = Set of communication rules
* Elements = Encoding, Formatting, Size, Timing, Delivery

# 🔄 Lecture 4: Network Protocols – Part 2 (Flash Notes)

## ✅ Outcomes

* Review the five elements of a protocol
* Understand Peer-to-Peer vs Client-Server Networks

---

## 📜 Recap: What is a Protocol?

* **Protocol** = Set of rules that govern:

  * What is communicated
  * How it is communicated
  * When it is communicated

## 🧱 5 Key Elements of a Protocol

### 1️⃣ Message Encoding

* Wired devices: Data → Signals
* Wireless devices: Data → Waves
* Router converts waves to signals and vice versa

### 2️⃣ Message Formatting & Encapsulation

* Sender and receiver agree on data format
* Encapsulate data with:

  * **Source IP address**
  * **Destination IP address**

### 3️⃣ Message Timing

* **Flow Control**: Prevent fast sender from overwhelming slow receiver
* **Timeouts**: Resend if no acknowledgment is received in time

### 4️⃣ Message Size

* Break large data into **smaller segments**
* **Sequence numbers** help receiver reassemble and detect missing pieces

### 5️⃣ Message Delivery Options

| Mode          | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Unicast**   | One sender → One receiver           |
| **Multicast** | One sender → A group of receivers   |
| **Broadcast** | One sender → All devices in network |

## 🌐 Network Types

### 🔁 Peer-to-Peer Network

* Every device is a **peer** (equal authority)
* No centralized administration
* Not scalable (limited ports)
* Suitable for small networks only

### 🖥️ Client-Server Network

* **Server** = Master, Clients = Slaves
* Centralized control and data management
* **Scalable**, handles many clients
* Risk: **Server overload** if too many requests

---

## 🔁 Recap Summary

* Reviewed 5 protocol elements with real-world examples
* Learned difference between Peer-to-Peer and Client-Server networks
