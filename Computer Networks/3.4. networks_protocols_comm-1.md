## 📡 Data Communication

* **Data Communication** = Exchange of data between two nodes via a medium (e.g., cable)

## 🔄 Data Flow Types

| Type        | Description                          | Example        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Simplex     | One-way communication                | Keyboard → CPU |
| Half Duplex | Two-way, but one direction at a time | Walkie-talkie  |
| Full Duplex | Two-way simultaneously               | Telephone call |

## 📜 What is a Protocol?

* **Protocol** = Set of **rules** that govern data communication
* Ensures: What, How, and When communication happens

### 🔑 Basic Components of Any Communication:

* **Source** (Sender)
* **Destination** (Receiver)
* **Medium** (Channel)
* **Protocol** (Rules)

---

## 📋 Why Protocols Are Needed

* Ensure mutual understanding between sender and receiver
* Prevent chaos (e.g., language mismatch, speed mismatch)

---

## 🧱 Elements of a Protocol

### 1️⃣ Message Encoding

* Data is converted to **signals** (wired) or **waves** (wireless) for transmission
* Receiver **decodes** the signals into understandable data

### 2️⃣ Message Formatting & Encapsulation

* Agreed **structure** for data
* Add **source and destination info** to the message for correct delivery

### 3️⃣ Message Size

* Large data is **broken into smaller chunks** to match link capacity

### 4️⃣ Message Timing

* **Flow control**: Prevent sender from overwhelming receiver
* **Timeouts & Acknowledgements**: Ensure delivery confirmation

### 5️⃣ Message Delivery Options

* **Unicast**: One sender → One receiver
* **Multicast**: One sender → Some receivers
* **Broadcast**: One sender → All receivers

---

## 🧠 Quick Recap

* Data Communication = Exchange between nodes
* Flow Types = Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex
* Protocols = Set of communication rules
* Elements = Encoding, Formatting, Size, Timing, Delivery

# 🔄 Lecture 4: Network Protocols – Part 2 (Flash Notes)

## ✅ Outcomes

* Review the five elements of a protocol
* Understand Peer-to-Peer vs Client-Server Networks

---

## 📜 Recap: What is a Protocol?

* **Protocol** = Set of rules that govern:

  * What is communicated
  * How it is communicated
  * When it is communicated

## 🧱 5 Key Elements of a Protocol

### 1️⃣ Message Encoding

* Wired devices: Data → Signals
* Wireless devices: Data → Waves
* Router converts waves to signals and vice versa

### 2️⃣ Message Formatting & Encapsulation

* Sender and receiver agree on data format
* Encapsulate data with:

  * **Source IP address**
  * **Destination IP address**

### 3️⃣ Message Timing

* **Flow Control**: Prevent fast sender from overwhelming slow receiver
* **Timeouts**: Resend if no acknowledgment is received in time

### 4️⃣ Message Size

* Break large data into **smaller segments**
* **Sequence numbers** help receiver reassemble and detect missing pieces

### 5️⃣ Message Delivery Options

| Mode          | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Unicast**   | One sender → One receiver           |
| **Multicast** | One sender → A group of receivers   |
| **Broadcast** | One sender → All devices in network |

## 🌐 Network Types

### 🔁 Peer-to-Peer Network

* Every device is a **peer** (equal authority)
* No centralized administration
* Not scalable (limited ports)
* Suitable for small networks only

### 🖥️ Client-Server Network

* **Server** = Master, Clients = Slaves
* Centralized control and data management
* **Scalable**, handles many clients
* Risk: **Server overload** if too many requests

---

## 🔁 Recap Summary

* Reviewed 5 protocol elements with real-world examples
* Learned difference between Peer-to-Peer and Client-Server networks

# 🧩 Lecture 5: Components of a Computer Network – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand the 3 key components of a computer network:

  1. **Nodes**
  2. **Media**
  3. **Services**

---

## 1️⃣ Nodes

### 🔹 End Devices

* Initiate or terminate communication
* Examples: Computers, Network Printers, Smartphones, Tablets, VoIP Phones, Security Cameras

### 🔹 Intermediary Devices

* Forward data between end devices
* Examples: Switches, Routers, Wireless Access Points, Firewalls, Cell Towers, Hubs, Repeaters

---

## 2️⃣ Media (a.k.a. Links)

### 🔹 Wired Media (Guided)

* Ethernet cables (Twisted Pair):

  * **Straight-through** → different devices
  * **Crossover** → same devices (e.g., PC to PC)
* Fiber Optic: Light signals, fastest transmission
* Coaxial Cable: Audio/video (e.g., set-top box)
* USB: For short connections (e.g., PC to phone)

### 🔹 Wireless Media (Unguided)

* Uses **air** as medium
* Types:

  * **Infrared**: Short-range (e.g., TV remote)
  * **Radio Waves**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
  * **Microwaves**: Cellular systems (longer range)
  * **Satellite**: GPS, very long-distance

---

## 3️⃣ Network Services

* **Email**: Send/receive messages
* **Instant Messaging**: WhatsApp-like apps
* **File Sharing**: e.g., downloading from shared drives
* **WWW Access**: Access websites (e.g., amazon.com)
* **VoIP**: Voice-over-IP (e.g., Skype calls)

# 🌐 Lecture 7: Network Topologies – Flash Notes

## ✅ Outcomes

* Understand the layout of computer networks (topologies)
* Learn about **Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh, and Hybrid** topologies
* Identify advantages and disadvantages of each

---

## 🧱 What is Network Topology?

* **Topology** = Arrangement of nodes in a network
* **Physical Topology**: Physical placement of nodes
* **Logical Topology**: Path of data flow between nodes

---

## 🔄 Types of Topologies

### 1️⃣ Bus Topology

* All nodes share a **common transmission medium**
* **Bi-directional** data flow

#### ✔️ Pros:

* Low cost
* Easy for temporary networks
* Node failure doesn’t affect others

#### ❌ Cons:

* Link failure breaks network
* No fault tolerance
* Low security

---

### 2️⃣ Ring Topology

* Nodes form a **closed loop**
* **Unidirectional** data flow (via token)

#### ✔️ Pros:

* Equal access for all nodes
* Better than bus in performance

#### ❌ Cons:

* Single link failure breaks network
* High latency, no security, not fault tolerant

---

### 3️⃣ Star Topology

* All nodes connect to a **central hub/switch**

#### ✔️ Pros:

* Easy to set up
* Centralized admin
* Scalable

#### ❌ Cons:

* Hub failure = total network failure
* Expensive (hub cost)
* Bottlenecks under heavy load

---

### 4️⃣ Mesh Topology

* Each node connected to **every other node**

#### ✔️ Pros:

* 100% fault tolerance
* Reliable communication paths

#### ❌ Cons:

* Very expensive (too many links)
* Impractical for large networks

---

### 5️⃣ Hybrid Topology

* **Combination** of two or more topologies
* Example: Star + Mesh + Bus = Hybrid

## 🧠 Recap Table

| Topology | Key Trait            | Major Limitation         |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Bus      | Simple, cheap        | Not fault tolerant       |
| Ring     | Token-based access   | Unidirectional, fragile  |
| Star     | Centralized control  | Hub failure = total down |
| Mesh     | Full fault tolerance | High cost, impractical   |
| Hybrid   | Flexible             | Complex to design/manage |
